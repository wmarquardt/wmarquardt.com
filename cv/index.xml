At the beginning of 2021, I started to work at Globo, the biggest media-tech company in Latin America. I&amp;rsquo;ve Always been fascinating with Globo innovations and I always followed events and talks with Globo engineers. I am part of the DB-Dev Team, which creates solutions for Database admins. Our main product is the DBaaS, an open-source platform like Amazon RDS which provisions and manages databases on demand, currently compatible with Redis, MongoDB and MySQL databases.</description></item></channel></rss>
